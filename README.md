# 🌍 Global Credential Interoperability Protocol (GCIP)

Welcome to the Global Credential Interoperability Protocol – a blockchain-powered solution designed to standardize and verify professional credentials across borders for migrant workers! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project addresses the real-world problem of credential fragmentation, where migrant workers struggle with verifying education, skills, certifications, and work experience in new countries. This leads to delays in employment, underemployment, or exploitation. GCIP creates a decentralized, tamper-proof system for issuing, storing, and verifying credentials globally, ensuring trust and efficiency without relying on centralized authorities.

## ✨ Features

🔗 Standardized credential issuance for education, skills, and work history  
✅ Instant cross-border verification by employers or immigration authorities  
📂 Secure, user-controlled credential wallets on the blockchain  
🚫 Revocation and update mechanisms for expired or invalid credentials  
🌐 Interoperability with multiple credential standards (e.g., inspired by Verifiable Credentials specs)  
🔍 Audit trails for all verifications to ensure transparency and compliance  
🛡️ Governance for adding trusted issuers and protocol upgrades  
💰 Utility token for verification fees to incentivize network participation  

## 🛠 How It Works

GCIP leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a robust ecosystem. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **IssuerRegistryContract**: Manages a registry of trusted credential issuers (e.g., universities, employers, certification bodies). Only registered issuers can issue credentials. Functions include `register-issuer`, `verify-issuer`, and `remove-issuer` (governed by votes).

2. **CredentialIssuanceContract**: Allows registered issuers to create and sign verifiable credentials. Takes inputs like worker ID, credential type (e.g., degree, certification), details (hash of documents), and expiration. Emits events for new issuances.

3. **CredentialHolderContract**: Acts as a personal vault for migrant workers to store and manage their credentials. Users can `add-credential`, `update-credential`, or `share-credential` with verifiers via selective disclosure (revealing only necessary details).

4. **VerificationContract**: Enables third parties (e.g., employers) to verify credentials. Calls include `verify-credential` which checks issuer validity, signature, revocation status, and matches against the stored hash. Returns a boolean result with proof.

5. **RevocationContract**: Handles credential revocation by issuers (e.g., for fraud or expiration). Maintains a revocation list and integrates with verification to flag invalid credentials. Functions: `revoke-credential`, `check-revocation`.

6. **GovernanceContract**: Decentralized governance for protocol updates, such as adding new credential types or issuers. Uses a DAO-like voting system with utility tokens. Includes `propose-update`, `vote-on-proposal`, and `execute-proposal`.

7. **AuditLogContract**: Logs all key actions (issuances, verifications, revocations) in an immutable ledger for compliance and disputes. Queryable via `get-log-by-id` or `get-logs-by-user`.

8. **UtilityTokenContract**: Manages a SIP-10 compliant fungible token (GCIP Token) for paying small fees during verifications or issuances, deterring spam and rewarding node operators. Includes standard functions like `transfer`, `mint`, and `burn`.

**For Migrant Workers**  
- Register your wallet via CredentialHolderContract.  
- Receive credentials from issuers (e.g., your university issues a degree credential).  
- Store them securely and share proofs selectively when applying for jobs abroad.  

**For Issuers (e.g., Universities or Employers)**  
- Register via IssuerRegistryContract.  
- Use CredentialIssuanceContract to issue hashed, signed credentials.  
- Revoke if needed through RevocationContract.  

**For Verifiers (e.g., Employers or Governments)**  
- Query VerificationContract with a credential proof provided by the worker.  
- Get instant confirmation, backed by blockchain immutability.  
- Pay a small fee in GCIP Tokens for premium verifications.  

**For Protocol Maintainers**  
- Use GovernanceContract to propose and vote on changes, ensuring the system evolves with global standards.  

This setup ensures privacy (zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure in future iterations), security, and scalability. Deploy on Stacks for Bitcoin-anchored security!

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Clone the repo, install Clarity tools, and deploy the contracts to a Stacks testnet. Start by registering an issuer and issuing a sample credential. For full implementation details, check the `contracts/` directory (not included here – implement based on Clarity docs).  

Let's empower migrant workers with borderless opportunities! 🌟
